Expected Schema:
python# pricing_elasticity.csv
columns = ['plan', 'region', 'year', 'elasticity', 'conversion_rate']

# funnel_data.csv  
columns = ['step', 'count', 'step_order', 'plan', 'region', 'year']
Sample Data Generation:
pythonimport pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Generate sample pricing data
pricing_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'plan': np.random.choice(['Basic', 'Pro', 'Enterprise'], 1000),
    'region': np.random.choice(['North America', 'Europe', 'APAC'], 1000),
    'year': np.random.choice([2021, 2022, 2023, 2024], 1000),
    'elasticity': np.random.uniform(-2, 0, 1000),
    'conversion_rate': np.random.uniform(0.05, 0.25, 1000)
})
pricing_data.to_csv('data/processed/pricing_elasticity.csv', index=False)

🔍 Advanced Features
<details>
<summary><b>📊 Statistical Testing Framework</b></summary>
A/B Testing Capabilities

Frequentist Methods: Traditional hypothesis testing with p-values
Bayesian Analysis: Probability-based decision making
Power Analysis: Sample size calculation and experiment planning
Effect Size Estimation: Practical significance assessment

Statistical Methods
python# Frequentist Testing
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency
p_value = chi2_contingency(contingency_table)[1]

# Bayesian Analysis  
import numpy as np
samples_control = np.random.beta(alpha_c, beta_c, 10000)
samples_variant = np.random.beta(alpha_v, beta_v, 10000)
prob_variant_better = np.mean(samples_variant > samples_control)

# Power Analysis
from scipy.stats import norm
sample_size = ((z_alpha + z_beta) ** 2 * 2 * pooled_rate * (1 - pooled_rate)) / effect_size ** 2

<details>
<summary><b>🎛️ Interactive Filtering System</b></summary>
Global Filter Controls

Plan Selection: Filter by pricing tier (Basic, Pro, Enterprise)
Geographic Filtering: Region-specific analysis
Time Range Selection: Historical data analysis
Real-Time Updates: Dynamic dashboard refresh

Filter Implementation
python# Sidebar global filters
selected_plan = st.sidebar.selectbox("Pricing Plan", ["All", "Basic", "Pro", "Enterprise"])
selected_region = st.sidebar.selectbox("Region", ["All", "North America", "Europe", "APAC"])
selected_year = st.sidebar.slider("Year", 2021, 2024, 2024)

# Apply filters to data
df_filtered = df.copy()
if selected_plan != "All":
    df_filtered = df_filtered[df_filtered["plan"] == selected_plan]
if selected_region != "All":
    df_filtered = df_filtered[df_filtered["region"] == selected_region]
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>🔍 Troubleshooting</b></summary>
Common Issues
Q: Dashboard loading slowly
bash# Enable Streamlit caching
@st.cache_data
def load_data():
    return pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Optimize data processing
df = df.sample(n=1000)  # For large datasets
Q: SHAP visualizations not displaying
bash# Install required dependencies
pip install shap matplotlib

# Clear matplotlib cache
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.clf()  # Clear figure after each plot
Q: Memory issues with large datasets
bash# Use data sampling
df_sample = df.sample(frac=0.1)  # Use 10% of data

# Optimize pandas operations
df = df.astype({'categorical_column': 'category'})
